# visual_scanning_game
This is a simple text-based visual scanning game that was created for younger students to scan on their keyboard to improve visual attention and scanning abilities.


As of right now. The program runs in a single run using default settings for output of text and for assertion of letter by the user.


What will be done to improve this game is to add additional rounds and user input for those rounds.

After that, a possible scoring will be implemented.

Last, from there, there should be some assertion and testing put in place for more than one letter and perhaps even assertions of inputs.

For now, this is simply a project designed for learning and perhaps one day be used in the therpay space for teachers or therapists working with individuals with cognitive or visual processing disorder difficulties.

This is not a medical tool by any means, but a therapeutic tool for practice.
