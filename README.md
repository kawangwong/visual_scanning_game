# visual_scanning_game
This is a simple text-based visual scanning game that was created for practice with individuals to scan on their keyboard to improve visual attention, perception and scanning abilities.

The module used is [art](https://pypi.org/project/art/), is a pip module that can convert user input text into an ASCII art, with many different options of style and output.

As of right now. The program runs in a single run using default settings for output of text and for assertion of letter by the user and will prompt users for the number of rounds they wish to participate in.

After that, a possible scoring will be implemented.

Last, from there, there should be some assertion and testing put in place for more than one letter and perhaps even assertions of inputs. That way, we can print multiple letters for testing.

It may also be possible to create some sort of save function for scoring in case this was used as a metric assessment or repeated assessment. That can be implemented as an optional function.

For now, this is simply a project designed for learning and perhaps one day be used in the therapy space for teachers or therapists working with individuals with cognitive or visual processing disorder difficulties.

This is not a medical tool by any means, but a therapeutic tool for practice.

<h3>Visual Scanning</h3>
Visual scanning is a skill involving cognitive motoric abilities to look for objects in space. The ability itself can be recognition of a pattern, an object, of even seeking relevant visual information. In the context of this game, most health individuals should be able to recognize the ASCII art as a respective letter shape and then visually scan for it on the keyboard to identify and press with no issue.

For individuals with difficulties, this isn't an assessment tool for a be all end all as more assessments will be required to make a more definitive judgement on difficulties with visual skills.

Once again, This is not a medical tool by any means, but a therapeutic tool for practice.
