# visual_scanning_game
This is a simple text-based visual scanning game that was created for practice with individuals to scan on their keyboard to improve visual attention, perception and scanning abilities.

The module used is [art](https://pypi.org/project/art/), which is a pip module that can convert user input text into an ASCII art, with many different options of style and output.

Currently, the program will prompt the user for the number of rounds they wish to participate in. It will also print out a score in the end.
It will also create a text file post round for saved user data. This function will be implemented using a sys arg with a user name file check to ensure that functions will either append text or create and append. Purpose of save function for scoring in case this was used as a metric assessment or repeated assessment. That can be implemented as an optional function.

Last, from there, there should be some assertion and testing put in place for more than one letter and perhaps even assertions of inputs. That way, we can print multiple letters for testing.

This is simply a project designed for learning and perhaps one day be used in the therapy space for teachers or therapists working with individuals with cognitive or visual processing disorder difficulties.

This is not a medical tool by any means, but a therapeutic tool for practice.

<h3>Visual Scanning</h3>
Visual scanning is a skill involving cognitive motoric abilities to look for objects in space. The ability itself can be recognition of a pattern, an object, of even seeking relevant visual information. In the context of this game, most health individuals should be able to recognize the ASCII art as a respective letter shape and then visually scan for it on the keyboard to identify and press with no issue.

For individuals with difficulties, this isn't an assessment tool for a be all end all as more assessments will be required to make a more definitive judgement on difficulties with visual skills.

Once again, This is not a medical tool by any means, but a therapeutic tool for practice.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
Download Python 3.x and install.

Wget, fork, or [download source files](https://www.alphr.com/download-files-github/).

Pip install requirements.txt command (pip install -r requirements.txt) This will install the art module.

Check python is installed using python --version or python3 --version

Optional: Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). 

Run function.py script. with python or python3 or python3.exe or python3

If you want to save results to a text file, simply add a single word after the function.py command such as "python function.py yourname"

Your other option is to create a virtual environment first, and pip install -r requirements.txt
